NAME

    RPi::DigiPot::MCP4XXXX - Interface to the MCP4xxxx series digital
    potentiometers on the Raspbery Pi

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution allows you to interface directly with the MCP41xxx
    and MCP42xxx series digital potentiomenters attached to the SPI bus on
    the Raspberry Pi.

    The MCP41xxx units have a single built-in potentiometer, where the
    MCP42xxx units have two.

    Both series will operate on either 3.3V or 5V, as the potentiometers do
    not send anything back to the Pi's GPIO.
