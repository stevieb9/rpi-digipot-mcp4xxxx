=head1 NAME

RPi::DigiPot::MCP4XXXX - Interface to the MCP4xxxx series digital potentiometers
on the Raspbery Pi

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution allows you to interface directly with the MCP41xxx and
MCP42xxx series digital potentiomenters attached to the SPI bus on the
Raspberry Pi.

The MCP41xxx units have a single built-in potentiometer, where the MCP42xxx
units have two.

Both series will operate on either 3.3V or 5V, as the potentiometers do not send
anything back to the Pi's GPIO.

This software requires L<wiringPi|http://wiringpi.com> to be installed, as we
use its L<SPI library|http://wiringpi.com/reference/spi-library> to communicate
to the potentiometer over the SPI bus.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiates a new L<RPi::DigiPot::MCP4XXXX> object, initiates communication
with the SPI bus, and returns the object.

Parameters:

    $cs

Mandatory: Integer, the GPIO pin number that connects to the potentiometer's
Chip Select C<CS> pin. This is the pin we use to start and finish communication
with the device over the SPI bus.

    $channel

Mandatory: Integer, represents the SPI bus channel that the potentiometer is
connected to. C<0> for C</dev/spidev0.0> or C<1> for C</dev/spidev0.1>.

    $speed

Optional: Integer. The clock speed to communicate on the SPI bus at. Defaults
to C<1000000> (ie: C<1MHz>).

=head2 set

This method allows you to set the variable output on the potentiometer(s).
These units have 256 taps, allowing that many different output levels.

Parameters:

    $data

Mandatory: Integer bewteen C<0> for 0% output and C<255> for 100% output.

    $pot

Optional: Integer, instructs the software which of the onboard potentiometers
to set the output voltage on. C<1> for the first potentiometer, C<2> for the second, and C<3> to change the value on both. Defaults to C<1>.

NOTE: Only the MCP42xxx units have dual built-in potentiometers, so if you have
an MCP41xxx unit, leave the default C<1> set for this parameter.

=head2 shutdown

The onboard potentiometers allow you to shut them down when not in use,
resulting in electricity usage. Using C<set()> will bring it out of sleep.

Parameters:

    $pot

Optional: Integer, the built-in potentiometer to shut down. C<1> for the first
potentiometer, C<2> for the second, and C<3> to change the value on both.
Defaults to C<1>.

NOTE: Only the MCP42xxx units have dual built-in potentiometers, so if you have
an MCP41xxx unit, leave the default C<1> set for this parameter.


=head1 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

=head2 OVERVIEW

The MCP4xxxx series digital potentiometers operate as follows:

    - CS pin goes LOW, signifying data is about to be sent
    - exactly 16 bits are sent over SPI to the digipot (first 8 bits for control
      second 8 bits for data)
    - CS pin goes HIGH, signifying communication is complete

There must be exactly 16 bits of data clocked in, or the commands and data will
be thrown away, and nothing accomplished.

Here's a diagram of the two bytes combined into a single bit string, showing the
respective positions of the bits, and their function:

         |<-Byte 1: Control->|<-Byte 0: Data->|
         |                   |                |
    fcn: | command | channel |      data      |
         |---------|---------|----------------|
    bit: | 7 6 5 4 | 3 2 1 0 | 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0|
         --------------------------------------
           ^                                 ^
           |                                 |
       MSB (bit 15)                      LSB (bit 0)

=head2 CONTROL BYTE

The control byte is the most significant byte of the overall data being clocked
into the potentiometer, and consists of a command nibble and a channel nibble.

=head3 COMMAND

The command nibble is the most significant (leftmost) 4 bits of the control
byte (bits 7-4 in the above diagram). The following diagram describes all
possible valid values.

    Bits    Value
    -------------

    0000    NOOP
    0001    set a new resistance value
    0010    put potentiometer into 'shutdown' mode
    0011    NOOP

=head3 CHANNEL

The channel nibble is the least significant 4 bits (rightmost) of the control
byte (bits 3-0 in the above diagram). Valid values follow. Note that the
MCP41xxx series units have only a single potentiometer built in, there's but
one valid value for them.

    Bits    Value
    -------------

    0001    potentiometer 0
    0010    potentiometer 1 (MCP42xxx only)
    0011    both 0 and 1    (MCP42xxx only)

=head2 DATA BYTE

The data byte consists of the least significant 8 bits (rightmost) of the 16 bit
combined data destined to the potentiometer. Both the MCP41xxx and MCP42xxx
series potentiometers contain 256 taps, so the mapping of this byte is simple:
valid values are C<0> (0% output) through C<255> (100% output).

=head2 REGISTER BIT SEQUENCE

Here's an overview of the bits in order:

C<15-14>: Unused ("Don't Care Bits", per the datasheet)

C<13-12>: Command bits

C<11-10>: Unused

C<9-8>: Channel (built-in potentiomenter) select bits

C<7-0>: Potentiometer tap setting data (0-255)
