=head1 NAME

RPi::DigiPot::MCP4XXXX - Interface to the MCP4xxxx series digital potentiometers
on the Raspbery Pi

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution allows you to interface directly with the MCP41xxx and
MCP42xxx series digital potentiomenters attached to the SPI bus on the
Raspberry Pi.

The MCP41xxx units have a single built-in potentiometer, where the MCP42xxx
units have two.

Both series will operate on either 3.3V or 5V, as the potentiometers do not send
anything back to the Pi's GPIO.

This software requires L<wiringPi|http://wiringpi.com> to be installed, as we
use its L<SPI library|http://wiringpi.com/reference/spi-library> to communicate
to the potentiometer over the SPI bus.
